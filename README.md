# Challenge

## Challenge1- Postman Documentation

The API and Environment are documented with Postman. To find it go to folder :Challenge1_PostmanDocumentation.

## Challenge1- Test

The API doesnÂ´t suport all the time zone documented in https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/. This project help to discover all supported time zones.

## Challenge1- Webservice

This project used a Vaadin application with Spring Boot.

### Running the application

The project is a standard Maven project. To run it from the command line,
type `mvnw` (Windows), or `./mvnw` (Mac & Linux), then open
http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

You can also import the project to your IDE of choice as you would with any
Maven project. Read more on [how to set up a development environment for
Vaadin projects](https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/guide/install) (Windows, Linux, macOS).

### Deploying to Production

To create a production build, call `mvnw clean package -Pproduction` (Windows),
or `./mvnw clean package -Pproduction` (Mac & Linux).
This will build a JAR file with all the dependencies and front-end resources,
ready to be deployed. The file can be found in the `target` folder after the build completes.

Once the JAR file is built, you can run it using
`java -jar target/challenge1-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`

### Project structure

- `HomeView.java` in `src/main/java` contains the navigation setup (i.e., the
  side/top bar and the main menu). This setup uses
  [App Layout](https://vaadin.com/components/vaadin-app-layout).
- `views` package in `src/main/java` contains the server-side Java views of your application.
- `views` folder in `frontend/` contains the client-side JavaScript views of your application.
